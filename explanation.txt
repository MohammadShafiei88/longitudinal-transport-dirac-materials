We want to show how the surface Green’s function of an isolated semi-infinite lead can
be calculated.

The definition of the total retarded Green’s function of an isolated semi-infinite lead is
given by

g_L = [(E + iη)1 − H_L]^{-1}, (B.1)

where H_L is the Hamiltonian of the lead. As the Landauer–Büttiker formalism is used,
the leads are considered to be perfect conductors. Subsequently the matrix representation
of (E + iη)1 − H_L can be written in the following block tridiagonal form:

(E + iη)1 − H_L =

| d   -A   0    0   ... |
| -B   D  -A    0   ... |
|  0  -B   D   -A   ... |
|  0   0  -B    D   ... |
| ... ... ...  ...  ... |    (B.2)

d, A, B, D are matrices with dimension M × M, where M is the width of the lead.
The matrix D describes an isolated column of sites in the leads. The matrices A and
B represent the hopping between neighboring columns. The matrix d represents the
isolated column of the surface of the lead.

The total Green’s function of the semi-infinite lead g_L is partitioned the same way.
So Eq. (B.1) can be rewritten in the form

(E + iη)1 − H_L · g_L = 1. (B.3)

The subdivision of the Green’s function is analogous to that of the matrix (E + iη)1 − H_L.
So g_11 is the Green’s function of the first column at the surface of the lead.

If the first column of the matrix product is calculated, an infinite set of equations for g_11
is obtained:

d g_11 = 1 + A g_21, (B.4a)

D g_p1 = B g_{p−1,1} + A g_{p+1,1}   for p ≥ 2. (B.4b)

With the help of Eq. (B.4b) all Green’s functions g_p1 with even p = 2r can be expressed
in terms of Green’s functions with odd p:

g_{2r,1} = D^{-1} B g_{2r−1,1} + D^{-1} A g_{2r+1,1}. (B.5)

Inserting this into Eq. (B.4) yields:

(d − A D^{-1} B) g_11 = 1 + (A D^{-1} A) g_31, (B.6a)

(D − A D^{-1} B − B D^{-1} A) g_{2r+1,1}
= (B D^{-1} B) g_{2r−1,1} + (A D^{-1} A) g_{2r+3,1}. (B.6b)

Defining the renormalized matrices:

d' = d − A D^{-1} B, (B.7a)
D' = D − A D^{-1} B − B D^{-1} A, (B.7b)
A' = A D^{-1} A, (B.7c)
B' = B D^{-1} B, (B.7d)

the equations retain the same form and this procedure can be iterated.

After n iterations the surface Green’s function is approximated by:

g_11 ≈ d_n^{-1}. (B.9)

This iterative procedure allows an efficient numerical evaluation of the surface Green’s
function of semi-infinite leads.
